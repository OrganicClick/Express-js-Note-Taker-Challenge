## Description

This project is a logo maker application that utilizes object-oriented programming principles to generate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) logos. The application prompts the user for input regarding text, shapes, colors, and other design elements to create customized SVG logos. By leveraging object-oriented design, the application provides a flexible and scalable solution for logo creation.
